# Multi-Site Framework with Airtable Integration

## Background and Motivation

We're building a single framework (both frontend and backend) that can be used to deploy multiple websites. Each website will dynamically load content from Airtable, including:
- Images
- Text
- Links
- Colors
- Fonts
- Feature flags for functionality

Each website will have a unique domain and will present a completely different look and feel, even though they all use the same underlying codebase. The system will detect which site to display based on the URL, and will load the appropriate content and styling from Airtable.

From our Airtable schema, we can see:
- A "Sites" table for site-specific configuration (colors, fonts, domain, etc.)
- Features table linked to sites (Blog, Business listing articles, etc.)
- Pages table for site-specific pages
- Blog posts table for content
- Listing posts table for business listings

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Domain Recognition**: We need to detect which domain is being accessed to serve the appropriate site content.

2. **Dynamic Configuration**: We need a central configuration system that loads site-specific data from Airtable.

3. **Feature Flagging**: Some sites may need blog functionality, others may need listing functionality, etc.

4. **Component Flexibility**: Components need to adapt to different styling configurations.

5. **Performance**: We need to efficiently fetch and cache data from Airtable to minimize API calls.

6. **Typing**: We need a strong type system for the Airtable data to ensure type safety.

    - ✅ Use Category table data (Name, Description, Color) from Airtable
    - ✅ Add lazy loading within each category section
    - ✅ Create CategoryBlogSection component with "Load More" and "View All" functionality
    - ✅ Create API endpoint `/api/blog/posts/by-category` for category-specific posts

- **Blog Page Logic**: Automatically detects number of categories and switches between:
  - **Multiple Categories**: Shows category sections with titles, descriptions, and grouped posts
  - **Single Category**: Falls back to unified post listing with infinite scroll
- **Category Sections**: Each category displays:
  - Category name (with color theming from Airtable)
  - Category description from Airtable
  - Initial 6 posts with "Load More" button for progressive loading
  - "View All in [Category]" link to dedicated category page

- ✅ Dynamic site detection and content filtering operational
- ✅ Infinite scroll and pagination systems functional
- ✅ Category filtering logic fixed and working correctly

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### ✅ COMPLETED: Category-Based Blog Page Implementation

**Current Status: CATEGORY FILTERING FIXED & DEPLOYED**

**✅ Issue 1 - Data Fetching**: RESOLVED
- **Problem**: Had an async component (`AllPostsSection`) being used in JSX, which React doesn't support
- **Solution**: Moved data fetching logic to the main BlogPage component
- **Status**: ✅ Data fetching now working (9 posts displaying correctly)

**✅ Issue 2 - Category Filtering**: FIXED
- **Problem**: `getCategoriesBySiteId()` was returning 5 categories instead of expected 2
- **Root Cause**: Function was returning categories USED BY POSTS, not categories ASSIGNED TO SITE
- **Solution**: Updated function to filter by `Site` field assignment
- **Result**: Now correctly returns only 2 categories ("Amsterdam", "Sip and Paint") for this site

**🧪 Debug Version Deployed**:
- Created simplified debug version of blog page
- Temporarily removed CategoryBlogSection to isolate data fetching issues
- Added comprehensive debug logging and on-page debug info
- Shows all posts in unified listing (no category sections for now)

**📊 Debug Information Now Visible**:
The blog page now displays:
1. **Console Logs**: Site info, categories count, posts count, and combined posts data
2. **On-Page Debug Box**: Visual debug info showing:
   - Site name and ID
   - Number of categories found
   - Number of blog posts found  
   - Number of listing posts found
   - Total combined posts count

**✅ CATEGORY FILTERING ISSUE IDENTIFIED**:

The enhanced debugging logs revealed the exact problem:

**🔍 Current Situation:**
- **Total Categories in Airtable**: 5 categories found
- **Categories WITH Site Field**: Only 2 categories properly linked to site (recORZQLJbwzLsVU0):
  - "Amsterdam" (recHchA3isRS7X7Lg) ✅ HAS Site field
  - "Sip and Paint" (recj7vBCw0YONUFyG) ✅ HAS Site field
- **Categories WITHOUT Site Field**: 3 categories with no site association:
  - "Sip and Clay" (recFNiTIXwCunPy54) ❌ NO SITE FIELD
  - "Coffee and ceramics" (recPi01kyvfBkjYfB) ❌ NO SITE FIELD
  - "Rotterdam" (recXKGPqLBcQ1T3Ds) ❌ NO SITE FIELD

**🐛 Root Problem**: 
The `getCategoriesBySiteId()` function returns categories that are USED BY POSTS, not categories that are ASSIGNED TO THE SITE. This is why it returns 5 categories instead of the expected 2.

**🔧 Required Fix**: 
Need to change the category filtering logic to:
1. **Option A**: Only return categories that have a `Site` field linking to the current site
2. **Option B**: Return categories used by posts BUT filter to only those that also have site assignment
3. **Option C**: Provide configuration option for which approach to use

**📊 Debug Results Confirmed**:
- ✅ Data fetching is working (9 posts displaying correctly)
- ✅ Site detection is working (site: "sip and paints")
- ✅ Posts are displaying properly in unified listing
- ❌ Category filtering logic needs correction

**⚠️ Temporary Changes**:
- CategoryBlogSection component import temporarily removed (import issue)
- Always shows unified post listing instead of category sections
- Added debug information boxes

**✅ CATEGORY FILTERING FIX COMPLETED & TESTED**:

**Implemented Solution**: Option A - Site-Assigned Categories Only

**Changes Made**:
1. ✅ Fixed `getCategoriesBySiteId()` function to filter by Site field assignment
2. ✅ Re-added CategoryBlogSection component import
3. ✅ Restored category-based layout logic
4. ✅ Removed debug information
5. ✅ Fixed async JSX issues with proper data fetching

**Blog Page Logic Now Works As Intended**:
- **Multiple Categories (2+)**: Shows category sections with titles, descriptions, and grouped posts
- **Single Category (1)**: Falls back to unified post listing with infinite scroll
- **No Categories (0)**: Shows unified post listing

**✅ CONFIRMED WORKING RESULT**:
The site now correctly returns 2 assigned categories ("Amsterdam", "Sip and Paint"), and the blog page successfully displays these as separate category sections with their respective posts.

**Files Modified in This Fix**:
- `src/lib/airtable/content.ts` - Fixed `getCategoriesBySiteId()` function to filter by Site field assignment
- `src/app/blog/page.tsx` - Restored CategoryBlogSection import and category-based layout logic

**✅ ISSUE RESOLUTION COMPLETE**:
The category-based blog page implementation is now fully functional with proper site-specific category filtering.

**✅ All Enhancements Working**: Category sections now show 6 posts each with a single accent-styled button to view all posts in that category.
